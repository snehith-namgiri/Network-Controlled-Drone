# Network-Controller-Drone
Hey there!
- This project is all about the Drone. 
- In this project, I've created a network controlled drone which can be controller through Internet without any use of any RF technology.
- Here, I've used NodeMCU as the flight controller and the IP which is obtained when the NodeMCU is connected to the Internet is used as a medium for the transmission of data from transmitter to the controller.
- In this project laptop acts the transmitter in through a python script the commands are transmitter to the controller. 
- This drone is configured with PID constants as well, to ensure the better stability of the drone. 
- Here, we need to tune the PID constants while testing for the reduction of the errors in the stability.
